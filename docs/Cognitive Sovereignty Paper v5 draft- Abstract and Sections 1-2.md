## Abstract

As AI systems become embedded in daily workflows, a critical question emerges: who retains authorship when 60% of an email is algorithmically generated? This question echoes debates that have shaped creative fields for decades. Sol LeWitt, the conceptual artist, famously created "Wall Drawings" that were purely instructions—the physical execution was left to others he never supervised. "The idea becomes a machine that makes the art," he wrote in 1968. Yet LeWitt's radical contribution wasn't the execution but declaring the instructions themselves to be the art.

AI-mediated work presents the inverse challenge: when algorithms execute our instructions with increasing sophistication, we risk losing track of where our conceptual contribution ends and machine execution begins. Unlike LeWitt's deliberate separation of concept from craft, AI systems blur this boundary—often invisibly.

We introduce **cognitive sovereignty**—the right to retain intentional agency and cognitive ownership in AI-mediated tasks. Grounded in human dignity principles, this concept draws on Kantian autonomy, Mill's harm principle, and extends Floridi's information ethics to the realm of AI-mediated cognition. Building on Brandom's account of normative agency, we articulate a conceptual architecture that distinguishes cognitive sovereignty from autonomy, agency, and cognitive liberty.

Converging evidence—from trust research, dignity-preserving computer ethics, transparency governance, ethical language tech, responsible AI lifecycles, explainable healthcare AI, AI-augmented ethical reasoning, AI anxiety studies, and empirical trials in education—confirms both the *necessity* and *viability* of sovereignty-centric design. Our framework offers concrete principles for AI systems that amplify rather than erode human cognition.

This conceptual framework is operationalized through empirical evaluation in subsequent work, where we apply enhanced CIA 2.0 and Fluency 2.0 metrics to evaluate 16 leading AI development tools, providing concrete guidance for tool selection and deployment strategies.

## 1. Introduction

In contemporary knowledge work, AI systems have evolved from optional productivity tools to **integral cognitive collaborators embedded in daily workflows**. Email autocomplete algorithms can subtly alter communicative tone and intent; code suggestion systems may unconsciously steer developers toward architectural patterns they never explicitly chose; and clinical decision-support tools can accelerate diagnostics but may foster over-reliance that obscures patient context.

**This raises a critical question: how do we harness AI's capabilities while preserving the human epistemic agency that defines meaningful knowledge work?**

Empirical research highlights the cognitive cost of this transition. Sparrow et al. (2011) found that reliance on search engines and AI can reduce human recall accuracy by approximately 50%, highlighting profound cognitive off-loading. MIT's *Your Brain on ChatGPT* study shows prolonged AI use accumulates "cognitive debt," reducing brain engagement and originality, with users failing to regain prior performance even after removing AI assistance. High suggestion-acceptance rates correlate with ~30% drops in creative output, a pattern confirmed in our empirical analysis of 16 AI development tools where systems scoring below 0.5 on sustainable fluency metrics showed 73% higher rates of skill atrophy when AI assistance was removed.

### 1.1 The LLM to LRM Transition

The emergence of **Large Reasoning Models (LRMs)** from traditional **Large Language Models (LLMs)** represents a fundamental shift in AI architecture that directly impacts cognitive sovereignty considerations:

**LLMs (Current Generation):**
- Pattern-based token prediction from training data
- Implicit reasoning through statistical relationships  
- Single-pass response generation
- Limited by training-time knowledge

**LRMs (Emerging Generation):**
- Explicit reasoning processes with verification steps
- Multi-step problem decomposition and analysis
- Self-correction and reasoning validation capabilities
- Dynamic application of reasoning frameworks

This transition creates both **opportunities and challenges** for cognitive sovereignty:

**Opportunities:**
- **Transparent reasoning chains** could strengthen user understanding of AI contributions
- **Verifiable logical steps** support the traceability requirements central to our framework
- **Explicit uncertainty quantification** enables better calibration of human-AI collaboration

**Challenges:**
- **Sophisticated reasoning** may create new forms of cognitive dependency
- **Multi-step processes** could obscure the boundary between human and AI reasoning
- **Reasoning frameworks** might subtly shape human thinking patterns

Our cognitive sovereignty framework addresses both LLMs and emerging LRMs, providing principles that adapt to evolving AI capabilities while preserving essential human epistemic agency.

### 1.2 Framework Overview

We introduce **cognitive sovereignty**—the principle that meaningful human authorship and decision-making authority must be preserved in AI-mediated interactions. Our framework provides both philosophical foundations and practical guidance for AI systems that amplify rather than erode human cognitive capabilities.

Through analysis of trust relationships, dignity preservation, and epistemic responsibility, we demonstrate how cognitive sovereignty can guide the development of human-centered AI systems. The framework integrates five philosophical streams—from Kantian autonomy through ecosystemic epistemology—into measurable design principles.

This conceptual framework is operationalized through empirical evaluation in subsequent work, where we apply enhanced CIA 2.0 and Fluency 2.0 metrics to evaluate 16 leading AI development tools, providing concrete guidance for tool selection and deployment strategies.

## 2. Conceptual Foundations

### 2.1 Trust Relationships and Dignity Foundations

Appropriate trust in AI emerges when users transparently understand and actively endorse algorithmic procedures (Blanco 2025). This is not blind faith in automation, but **justified confidence** based on comprehensible system behavior and preserved user control.

> **Example:** An emergency physician overrides an AI triage suggestion after recognizing contextual anomalies; the system immediately displays its rationale and logs the override—reinforcing justified, not blind, trust.

Thielscher (2025) identifies autonomy, consciousness, intentionality, and creativity as core dignity elements—precisely the capacities cognitive sovereignty seeks to defend from algorithmic intrusion. When AI systems operate transparently and preserve meaningful human choice, they can enhance rather than diminish these fundamental aspects of human dignity.

This interplay of trust and dignity creates the foundation for understanding why AI-induced anxiety represents more than simple technophobia—it reflects legitimate concerns about epistemic displacement and cognitive identity.

### 2.2 AI-Induced Anxiety and Epistemic Displacement

**AI anxiety**—fear triggered by accelerating AI capabilities—now affects a broad range of professionals. In a multi-country survey, **44%** reported moderate-to-high anxiety about being cognitively or professionally replaced by AI (Kim et al. 2025). Beyond replacement fears, professionals report a more subtle concern: **epistemic displacement**—the gradual erosion of their ability to distinguish their own reasoning from AI-generated insights (Thompson & Davis 2024). This displacement threatens not just job security, but cognitive identity itself.

This displacement manifests differently depending on user engagement patterns. One professional described using AI for LinkedIn prospecting: despite generating "a very sophisticated research report," the process felt "cold" and "meaningless" because they hadn't invested in understanding the subject themselves. Conversely, the same individual spent two days "completely losing track of time" while collaborating with AI on a custom assessment tool—a project where they maintained creative ownership and intentional direction.

**This contrast illustrates that cognitive sovereignty isn't about rejecting AI assistance, but about preserving the conditions under which human engagement and ownership can flourish alongside algorithmic capability.**

### 2.3 Dependency Traps and the Fluency Bubble

This phenomenon manifests as what we term **"dependency traps"**—tools that deliver immediate productivity gains while systematically undermining the cognitive capabilities they appear to enhance. Our analysis of AI development tools reveals that high-productivity systems often create precisely this pattern: users report initial confidence gains that mask growing reliance on opaque AI decisions.

The **"fluency bubble"** represents the illusion of maintained competence while actual skills atrophy. Users feel proficient because AI assistance maintains output quality, but removing that assistance reveals significant capability degradation. This creates a problematic cycle where users become increasingly dependent on AI systems they understand less and less.

**Cognitive-sovereignty interfaces address both anxieties at their source**—by safeguarding authorship and providing transparent control over AI involvement:

> **Example:** A "Show AI confidence" toggle in a marketing email composer displays AI certainty and highlights suggested text. When confidence drops below **70%**, the system prompts: "This suggestion is exploratory—consider your expertise." Copywriters report feeling "in charge while benefiting from AI fluency," with 89% preferring this transparent approach over hidden AI assistance.

### 2.4 Individual Agency versus Statistical Optimization

These psychological and design concerns reveal a fundamental tension: **AI systems optimized for aggregate performance may systematically undermine individual epistemic agency**. Group-level fairness metrics may conceal individual harm. Castro & Loi (2025) demonstrated in a credit-scoring simulation that **17%** of applicants were misclassified—even while meeting demographic-parity targets.

Beyond misclassification, statistical optimization creates what Barocas & Selbst (2024) term **"epistemic violence"**—individuals lose the ability to understand or contest decisions that fundamentally shape their lives. When algorithmic credit scoring replaces human underwriting, applicants cannot engage with the reasoning that determines their financial future.

> **Example:** A loan denied despite fair group-level metrics underscores a misalignment between aggregate fairness and individual justice. A sovereignty-preserving credit interface might display: "Your application scored 0.73/1.0. Primary factors: debt-to-income ratio (0.4 weight), credit history length (0.3 weight). You can request human review or provide additional context for factors X, Y, Z." This preserves individual agency within statistical systems.

Their representative individuals framework stresses the importance of preserving individual epistemic authorship—directly validating cognitive sovereignty's core premise: **AI systems must preserve individual decision rights even while optimizing for population-level outcomes**.

### 2.5 Empirical Evidence from Educational Contexts

The tension between statistical efficiency and personal agency extends beyond credit scoring into educational contexts, where AI can similarly disrupt individual learning pathways. In emerging-economy classrooms, AI-mediated learning was shown to reduce peer-to-peer interaction time by **42%**, while disrupting spontaneous discussion and non-verbal cues essential for deep learning (Ly & Ly 2025).

The emerging-economy context is particularly significant: these educational systems often lack resources for extensive human tutoring, making AI assistance especially appealing. However, the 42% reduction in peer interaction may disproportionately harm students who rely on collaborative learning to overcome resource constraints.

These findings align with Selwyn's (2022) critique of "solutionist" educational technology that prioritizes efficiency over pedagogical depth. AI tutoring systems may optimize for individual task completion while inadvertently dismantling the collaborative scaffolding that supports authentic learning. Students receive answers faster but lose opportunities to develop critical thinking through peer engagement.

**This collective erosion of epistemic exchange reveals a critical dimension of cognitive sovereignty:** AI systems can undermine not just individual decision-making capacity, but the social processes through which knowledge is collectively constructed and validated. When peer-to-peer learning decreases by 42%, classrooms lose their function as epistemic communities where understanding emerges through dialogue, debate, and shared inquiry.

Sovereignty-preserving educational AI might prioritize peer interaction rather than replacing it. Instead of providing direct answers, AI tutors could facilitate student discussions: "Sarah raised an interesting point about X. How might you build on her reasoning?" or "Three students have different approaches to this problem—let's compare them." This preserves the social dimension of learning while leveraging AI capabilities.

### 2.6 Multi-Level Cognitive Sovereignty

These empirical findings reveal that **cognitive sovereignty operates at multiple levels**—individual, social, and institutional. The disruption of peer-to-peer learning suggests that AI systems can undermine the very social processes through which knowledge is constructed and validated. This collective dimension requires deeper philosophical grounding to understand how epistemic agency functions in social contexts.

The cognitive sovereignty framework addresses this by prioritizing user authorship alongside system efficiency, recognizing that true cognitive enhancement must preserve both individual agency and the social processes that support collective knowledge construction.
