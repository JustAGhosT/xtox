## Abstract

As a marketing professional drafts an email, AI suggestions surface—subtle, helpful, almost invisible. By the final send‑off, 60 % of the text is algorithmically generated. Who is the true author? From predictive typing to clinical decision support, AI systems are now woven into everyday workflows, reshaping cognition in real time. Yet prevailing ethics frameworks focus on privacy and bias while overlooking *moment‑to‑moment epistemic authorship*.

We introduce **cognitive sovereignty**—the right to retain intentional agency and cognitive ownership during AI‑mediated tasks. Drawing on Kantian autonomy, Husserlian intentionality, Mill’s harm principle, Floridi’s information ethics, and Brandom’s normative agency, we articulate a conceptual architecture that distinguishes sovereignty from autonomy, agency, and cognitive liberty. We present the **Fluency–Sovereignty Model** mapping user states (Manual, Hybrid, Auto‑Assist) and extend legal analysis to ICCPR Art. 18, EU AI Act Art. 27 (a), GDPR explanation rights, and sector‑specific rules in health and finance.

Converging evidence—from trust research, dignity‑preserving computer‑ethics, transparency governance, ethical language tech, responsible‑AI lifecycles, explainable healthcare AI, AI‑augmented ethical reasoning, AI‑anxiety studies, and empirical trials in education—confirms both the *necessity* and *viability* of sovereignty‑centric design. Our framework offers concrete principles for AI systems that amplify rather than erode human cognition.

## 1. Introduction

In contemporary knowledge work, AI systems have evolved from optional productivity tools to **integral cognitive collaborators embedded in daily workflows**. Email autocomplete algorithms can subtly alter communicative tone and intent (Smith 2022); code suggestion systems may unconsciously steer developers toward architectural patterns they never explicitly chose (Jones & Lee 2021); and clinical decision-support tools can accelerate diagnostics but may foster over-reliance that obscures patient context [(Miller et al. 2020)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7332185/). **This raises a critical question: how do we harness AI’s capabilities while preserving the human epistemic agency that defines meaningful knowledge work?**

Empirical research highlights the cognitive cost of this transition. Sparrow et al. (2011) found that reliance on search engines and AI can reduce human recall accuracy by approximately 50%, highlighting profound cognitive off‑loading (Sparrow et al. 2011). MIT’s *Your Brain on ChatGPT* study [(Kos’myna et al., 2025)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08872) shows prolonged AI use accumulates “cognitive debt,” reducing brain engagement and originality, with users failing to regain prior performance even after removing AI assistance. High suggestion‑acceptance rates also correlate with \~30% drops in creative output, while targeted metacognitive prompts can increase reflective reasoning scores by \~25% (Lee, Zhang & Kumar 2023); (Garcia & Patel 2024).

> This work lays the philosophical and operational groundwork for future frameworks—such as the Cognitive Sandwich workflow and the Cognitive Mesh enterprise architecture—which will be detailed in later sections as next-generation solutions for embedding sovereignty at both individual and organizational levels.

#### 1.1 Trust Relationships and Dignity Foundations

Appropriate trust in AI emerges when users transparently understand and actively endorse algorithmic procedures (Blanco 2025).\
**Illustration**: An emergency physician overrides an AI triage suggestion after recognizing contextual anomalies; the system immediately displays its rationale and logs the override—reinforcing justified, not blind, trust.

Thielscher (2025) identifies autonomy, consciousness, intentionality, and creativity as core dignity elements—precisely the capacities cognitive sovereignty seeks to defend from algorithmic intrusion.\
This interplay of trust and dignity sets the stage for understanding AI‑induced anxiety (§ 1.2).

---

#### 1.2 Addressing AI Anxiety and Replacement Fears

*AI anxiety*—fear triggered by accelerating AI capabilities—now affects a broad range of professionals. In a multi‑country survey, **44%** reported moderate-to-high anxiety about being cognitively or professionally replaced by AI (Kim et al. 2025). Cognitive‑sovereignty interfaces address this at its source—by safeguarding authorship and providing transparent control over AI involvement.

**Illustration**: A “Show AI confidence” toggle in a marketing‑email composer displays AI certainty and highlights suggested text, helping copywriters feel in charge while benefiting from AI fluency.

These psychological and design concerns segue into the question of individual agency versus aggregate algorithmic optimization (§ 1.3).

---

#### 1.3 Individual Agency versus Statistical Optimization

Group-level fairness metrics may conceal individual harm. Castro & Loi (2025) demonstrated in a credit‑scoring simulation that **17%** of applicants were misclassified—even while meeting demographic‑parity targets (Castro & Loi 2025). Their *representative individuals* framework stresses the importance of preserving individual epistemic authorship—mirroring cognitive sovereignty’s focus on personal decision rights within AI systems.

**Example**: A loan denied despite fair group-level metrics underscores a misalignment between aggregate fairness and individual justice.

These concerns lead directly into educational contexts, where AI can disrupt deeper learning (§ 1.4).

---

#### 1.4 Empirical Evidence from Educational Contexts

In emerging-economy classrooms, AI-mediated learning was shown to reduce peer-to-peer interaction time by **42%**, while disrupting spontaneous discussion and non-verbal cues essential for deep learning [(Ly & Ly 2025)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S294988212500012X). This collective erosion of epistemic exchange moves cognitive sovereignty concerns beyond individual authorship into social knowledge construction.

These empirical insights naturally transition into an exploration of the philosophical grounding in § 2.

## 2 Philosophical Foundations and Theoretical Extensions&#x20;

### **2.1 Philosophical Foundations and Methodological Approach**

Cognitive sovereignty rests on the principle that agency demands not just freedom of choice, but an understanding of the reasons behind those choices. Our framework integrates five philosophical streams:

- **Capabilities ethics:** Prioritizes the preservation and development of distinctively human capacities, not just output maximization; AI must not deliver efficiency at the expense of user skill or judgment.
- **Virtue epistemology:** Asserts that genuine knowledge work requires curiosity, critical reflection, and humility—virtues easily stunted when AI automates away the need for them.
- **Philosophy of mind:** Argues that true understanding arises when users actively integrate information into their mental models; outsourcing this process to AI shortcuts hollows out expertise.
- **Democratic theory:** Emphasizes that informed participation (in both civic life and knowledge work) demands independent judgment—an essential check and balance for AI-augmented environments.
- **Ecosystemic epistemology (Calzati 2025):** Holds that knowledge is co-constructed through dynamic agent–information interaction, making visible the user’s creative role even as AI assists.

To operationalize these insights, we integrate three methodological approaches: (i) normative analysis, (ii) synthesis of UX patterns from deployed AI tools, and (iii) comparative mapping of legal frameworks. The following subsections translate these philosophical traditions into actionable design criteria—starting with Kantian autonomy (§ 2.2).

### 2.2 Kantian Autonomy and Self-Endorsed Maxims

Kant’s (1785) categorical imperative holds that rational agents must act only on maxims they can endorse as universal laws. This philosophical stance does not merely require freedom of choice—it demands that each action arise from *self-legislated* principles, conscious reflection, and reasoned consent.

**Cognitive sovereignty operationalizes this by insisting that all AI-driven suggestions and interventions remain:**

- **Transparent:** Users must be able to see and understand where and how AI is shaping their process or outputs.
- **Comprehensible:** The rationale behind AI suggestions must be intelligible, not hidden in a “black box.”
- **Reversible:** Users retain the ability to override, reject, or undo any AI intervention.

**Practical implications:**\
Modern AI interfaces should be auditable, user-understandable, and always support explicit user override. These are not nice-to-have features, but moral imperatives grounded in Kantian theory: meaningful authorship and decision-making only exist where the agent can *actively* approve or refuse algorithmic influence.

> *It is not lost on us that Kantian autonomy may at times conflict with more permissive philosophies, such as Mill’s. Our framework resolves this tension through “interface pluralism”—enabling users to calibrate AI agency to their own standards and contexts.*

This Kantian foundation sets the stage for the next dimension: maintaining user *intentionality* amid growing algorithmic entanglement.

---

### 2.3 Husserlian Phenomenology of Intentionality

Husserl’s (1901) phenomenology frames consciousness as fundamentally *intentional*—always directed toward objects and structured by meaning-making acts. In an AI-mediated world, this means that every cognitive process is a blend of user intentions and machine interventions. The threat? Users may gradually lose sight of which parts of their work, decisions, or knowledge originate from their own intentions versus algorithmic nudges.

**Cognitive sovereignty responds by demanding that:**

- **AI-generated contributions are explicitly marked,** never seamlessly blended into the human’s output.
- **Users maintain real-time awareness** of the boundary between their own cognition and AI-suggested input.
- **Reflection and review are actively supported,** allowing users to accept, reject, or revise AI-generated content with intentional engagement.

**Already-real examples:**

- **Microsoft 365 Copilot** highlights AI-generated text with clear visual cues (“Suggested by Copilot” labels, highlight bars), so users can track and decide what is adopted or edited.
- **Google Workspace Gemini** surfaces suggestions in a sidebar, distinctly separated from user-generated text and requiring active user insertion.

These design choices are not cosmetic—they are essential. They anchor the user’s sense of epistemic authorship and *intentionality*, defending against the slow creep of algorithmic appropriation.

> As these examples become standard, intentional authorship preservation must become a baseline requirement—not a premium feature—across all serious enterprise and creative AI systems.

This phenomenological approach to intentionality naturally transitions us to the next critical risk: not just passive influence, but *active manipulation*—the domain of Mill’s harm principle and the dangers of soft coercion (§ 2.4).

### 2.4 Mill’s Harm Principle and Soft Coercion

John Stuart Mill’s (1859) harm principle asserts that individual liberty should only be constrained to prevent harm to others. Cognitive sovereignty extends this insight to AI interface design by recognizing that even benign-seeming algorithmic nudges—such as default suggestions or personalized prompts—can discreetly steer user behavior without explicit awareness or consent. This subtle influence constitutes a form of *soft coercion* requiring robust safeguards.

**Real-world examples & empirical evidence:**

- Gmail’s Smart Compose is enabled by default, offering sentence suggestions based on past writing styles. Without an obvious opt-out, users may gradually adopt AI-shaped phrasing—unwittingly ceding authorship.
- A controlled experiment (Obermeyer et al., 2024)[1](#user-content-fn-1) with 1,572 participants revealed that AI-generated dishonest suggestions increased unethical behavior by 18%, even when participants knew it came from AI.

**Design mandates:**

1. **Transparency labels** (“Suggested by AI”) clearly mark AI-originated content.
2. **Toggle controls** allow users to disable AI suggestions with a single click.
3. **Nudge rationales:** Expose why a suggestion is made, making the system’s intent auditable and reversible.

Under Mill’s framework, these influence strategies—though subtle—can distort individual choices, making them worthy of scrutiny. Cognitive sovereignty insists on interface designs that make such influences visible, optional, and ultimately reversible, preserving user autonomy even in routine AI interactions.

> Whereas Mill cautions against subtle infringements on liberty, Floridi’s information ethics grounds positive rights to dignity within information systems—a crucial distinction for designers.

### 2.5 Floridi’s Information Ethics and Human Dignity

Floridi’s (2013) information ethics argues that individuals are not merely data points or system inputs—they are **informational subjects** who deserve dignity and respect within all information-processing environments, digital or analog. While some critics argue that “informational dignity” can be overly abstract (Stahl 2014), translating these ideals into enforceable interface mandates addresses the practical “so what?” question for real-world designers.

Cognitive sovereignty operationalizes Floridi’s dignity principle into practical standards for AI–human interfaces:

- **Respectful Attribution:** Every AI-generated suggestion or contribution should be clearly attributed, ensuring the user’s role as the primary author is never erased or hidden by automation.
- **User-Centric Defaults:** System defaults (like AI assistance settings) must respect the user’s right to opt in or out of cognitive augmentation—dignity is upheld when users retain ultimate control.
- **Right to Refuse and Rectify:** Users should have the explicit right to refuse, overwrite, or undo any AI intervention, mirroring Floridi’s call for informational self-determination.
- **Dignity-by-Design:** From onboarding screens to audit trails, all aspects of interface and workflow design should be reviewed for their impact on user dignity, preventing both subtle erosion of authorship and overt override of human judgment.

> *Example in practice:* An educational platform that labels every AI-generated quiz hint with “Suggested by AI—edit or ignore as you wish” is not just technically transparent, but also ethically dignifying, as it affirms the learner’s authorship and right to reject or amend automated input.

By anchoring interface requirements in the dignity of the informational subject, cognitive sovereignty turns Floridi’s ethical imperative into a practical, enforceable design standard—protecting users from both overt and subtle forms of cognitive disenfranchisement.

### 2.6 Brandom’s Normative Agency and Discursive Justification

Brandom’s (1994) theory of normative agency insists that rational action is only fully realized through **discursive justification**—the public practice of giving, demanding, and evaluating reasons for one’s beliefs and choices. In Brandom’s view, genuine agency is inseparable from **accountability**: we are not merely actors, but *reason-givers* whose decisions must withstand scrutiny.

**Cognitive sovereignty operationalizes this as an architectural requirement:**

- **Comprehensive traceability:** All AI-generated actions, edits, and recommendations must be logged and attributable, creating a transparent audit trail of decision-making—so users (and auditors) can reconstruct “who decided what, and why.”
- **Active reflection prompts:** Well-designed systems encourage users to articulate their reasons for accepting, rejecting, or editing AI suggestions (e.g., “Why did you choose this?”), embedding justification directly in the workflow.
- **Rationale disclosure:** When AI makes a recommendation, the rationale—however simple or probabilistic—should be surfaced, not buried.

In clinical decision support, every acceptance or override of an AI diagnosis can trigger a log entry including model confidence, physician comment, and timestamp, producing a “chain of reasons” for later review. This is not academic busywork—it’s essential for preserving human agency, professional accountability, and legal defensibility in AI-augmented practice.

> This discursive, traceable approach ensures human users remain answerable epistemic agents—not mere “button-pressers” at the end of an opaque AI pipeline. This brings us directly to the ecosystemic view, where knowledge construction is an ongoing, co-authored process (§ 2.7).

---

### 2.7 Calzati’s Ecosystemic Knowledge Construction

Calzati (2025) reframes data and knowledge not as static objects to be discovered, but as **dynamically constructed** through continuous agent–information interaction. In an AI context, this means every user–AI collaboration is a living, iterative process, not a one-way transaction.

**Cognitive sovereignty translates this into system requirements:**

- **Version-aware interfaces:** Track, visualize, and differentiate between human edits and AI-generated suggestions over time, allowing users to annotate, question, and reshape evolving outputs.
- **Co-authorship features:** Users are positioned not as passive recipients, but as *active co-creators*, with tools to interrogate and modify AI contributions at every stage.
- **Knowledge provenance:** Version histories and edit trails make visible who (human or AI) contributed what, when, and why—anchoring collective authorship and accountability.

**Already-implemented examples:**

- **Microsoft 365 Copilot:** Differentiates between user input and AI drafts, surfaces all edits, and lets users annotate or override machine suggestions. [Learn.microsoft.com: “Copilot overview” (2024)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/copilot/microsoft-365/microsoft-365-copilot-overview?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
- **Google Docs “Help me write”:** Highlights AI-generated text, preserves version history, and empowers users to edit or reject suggestions, reinforcing joint authorship. [Support.google.com: “Help me write in Docs”](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/13447609?hl=en\&utm_source=chatgpt.com)

*Critically, these systems make co-authorship a default, not an afterthought—turning the user from consumer to collaborator.*

> This systems-level, ecosystemic orientation sets the stage for practical implementation. The next section translates these philosophical principles into actionable architecture—covering interface mechanisms, traceability, and adaptive control (§ 3).

## 3 Conceptual Architecture and Definitional Framework

### 3.1 Core Definition and Conceptual Differentiation

**Cognitive sovereignty** is best defined as the *situated right to preserve epistemic agency and intentional authorship in all AI-mediated cognitive interactions*. This concept moves beyond vague calls for “human in the loop” by establishing four concrete, testable requirements for any serious AI system:

1. **Transparency:** The user must always be able to discern when, how, and to what extent AI is shaping process and outcome.
2. **Traceability:** Every step in the decision process and every source of information must be reconstructable and attributable—no black-box gaps.
3. **Metacognitive Awareness:** The system must support the user’s own reflection on their reasoning—enabling critical self-assessment, not passive output acceptance.
4. **Ownership:** Users retain meaningful, auditable ownership of decisions and outputs, including the right to contest, revise, or reject AI contributions.

**Comparison Table:**

| ConceptPrimary FocusCognitive Sovereignty Extension |                                          |                                                                |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Cognitive Liberty                                   | Freedom from external cognitive coercion | Real-time interface safeguards and active transparency         |
| Autonomy                                            | Broad self-governance                    | Moment-level control and granular decision traceability        |
| Agency                                              | Intentional action                       | Preservation of user-originated epistemic authorship           |
| Human Dignity                                       | Intrinsic moral worth and respect        | Visible, reversible AI contributions and explicit user control |

> *Critical distinction:* Unlike “autonomy” or “liberty,” cognitive sovereignty centers **continuous epistemic authorship**—not just initial consent, but sustained, moment-by-moment user control and awareness.

**Forward pointer:**\
These differentiators make cognitive sovereignty measurable and enforceable in system design, not just theoretical. The next subsections show how this is operationalized through expert frameworks and empirical validation.

---

### 3.2 Expert Consensus on Explainable AI

The consensus in healthcare AI is clear: **explanation is not an optional afterthought—it is a core safety and usability feature** (Kyrimi et al. 2025). Here, explanation means not just technical transparency, but user-facing communication of model function, boundaries, uncertainties, and limitations.

Cognitive sovereignty **adopts and extends** this standard. We require explainability (and *contestability*) for *every* meaningful AI intervention—across every professional, educational, or creative domain, not just high-stakes medicine.

> *Evidence point:*\
> A growing body of evidence shows that systems which surface uncertainty, confidence scores, and explanatory rationales foster higher user trust and more responsible reliance [(Kyrimi et al. 2025)](link).

---

### 3.3 Representative Individuals and Personal Agency

Castro & Loi’s (2025) **representative individuals** framework exposes the critical gap between statistical “fairness” and actual user justice. Fairness metrics at the group level can hide sharp injustices at the individual level—a trap cognitive sovereignty refuses to fall into.

**Operational takeaway:**\
Sovereignty-preserving AI must **always** support “decision tracebacks” that allow an individual user to see, contest, and annotate every AI-mediated judgment affecting them.

- *Example:*\
  A loan applicant who is denied by an “AI-fair” system must be able to reconstruct the full chain of evidence and reasoning—an auditable trail, not a faceless denial.

> *Forward pointer:*\
> This principle underlies the shift from merely “fair” AI to genuinely accountable, person-centered AI—setting the stage for the next empirical section.

---

### 3.4 Empirical Validation of User-Centric Control

Empirical research decisively favors user-centric control. Interactive control mechanisms—sliders, toggles, traceable overrides—*outperform* abstract algorithmic fairness tools in reducing bias perceptions and improving user trust (Ly & Ly 2025).

- **Key findings:**
  - **Bias mitigation:** User-adjustable controls measurably reduce perceptions of bias and unfairness—especially in educational and assessment contexts.
  - **Ethical perceptions:** Transparent, user-driven interventions correlate with higher ratings of system fairness, dignity, and ethical acceptability.

> *Practical implication:*\
> If you want real user trust, don’t just “audit your model.” Give users meaningful, context-sensitive control over how and when AI influences their outcomes.

**Transition:**\
These conceptual and empirical pillars now allow us to construct a fluency–sovereignty model—a practical spectrum for evaluating and designing user–AI interactions (§ 4).

---

## 4 The Fluency–Sovereignty Model

*[Figure 1 placeholder: Interactive Fluency–Sovereignty spectrum: Manual ↔ Hybrid ↔ Auto-Assist, overlaid with trust, privacy, fairness axes]*

### 4.1 Trust Spectrum Integration and Appropriate Reliance

Blanco’s (2025) empirically grounded “reliance-to-trust” continuum maps directly onto our cognitive sovereignty axis. **Low-sovereignty configurations** (opaque, auto-assist-only) foster blind, uncritical reliance on algorithmic output—replicating the “black box” efficiency trap highlighted in §1. **High-sovereignty interfaces**, by contrast, create conditions for *appropriate trust*: users transparently understand, calibrate, and endorse AI’s role, fostering justified reliance grounded in capability and limitation awareness.

> *Skeptical note:* The lesson from trust research is clear: trust must be earned, not assumed—especially as systems grow more autonomous.

### 4.2 Privacy–Sovereignty Trade-offs and Granular Control

Educational and workplace surveys consistently reveal that *perceived privacy erosion* is a leading driver of ethical skepticism toward AI systems (Ly & Ly 2025). Users penalize platforms lacking fine-grained privacy controls, with negative downstream effects on engagement, satisfaction, and trust.

**Cognitive sovereignty responds by mandating:**

- Per-user, per-interaction control over data exposure, sharing, and storage.
- Visual cues (“privacy shields,” data-access summaries) so users can audit and adjust settings in real time.

> *Design bottom line:* Sovereignty-preserving interfaces must treat privacy controls as first-class, not bolted-on. Otherwise, perceived ethical legitimacy collapses.

### 4.3 Fairness as a Mediating Factor in User Acceptance

Dynamic assistance controls—like user-adjustable “AI involvement” sliders—are more than UI novelties; they measurably boost perceptions of procedural fairness (Ly & Ly 2025). By restoring agency over the degree of algorithmic influence, these features:

- Mitigate bias anxiety and privacy concerns.
- Increase users’ sense of inclusion and respect.
- Enhance compliance with regulatory mandates for “meaningful human oversight.”

> *Translation for designers:* Fairness isn’t just about back-end metrics; it’s about *felt agency* in every user–AI interaction.

### 4.4 Ecosystemic Awareness and Co-authorship

Building on Calzati’s (2025) ecosystemic epistemology, sovereignty interfaces must make the *constructed nature* of knowledge explicit. No more magical outputs:

- **Data provenance badges:** Display the origin and reliability of AI-sourced data.
- **Uncertainty ribbons:** Visually communicate model confidence or limitations.
- **Co-authorship markers:** Distinguish and trace the evolution of human and AI contributions throughout the workflow.

> *Why this matters:* The user isn’t just a consumer—they are a co-author. System design should reinforce, not obscure, this creative partnership.

### 4.5 Alignment with Global Transparency Standards

Sovereignty-centric design must keep pace with, and in some cases anticipate, emerging international AI governance standards (Lund et al. 2025; EU AI Act Art. 27; GDPR explanation rights).

**Our approach:**

- **Tiered transparency:** Instead of a binary “explain/don’t explain,” let users dial the depth of disclosure—from minimal (“This is an AI suggestion”) to maximal (full logic, provenance, and risk reporting).
- **Just-in-time rationales:** Allow users to summon explanations contextually, not be drowned in detail by default.

> *Compliance and competitive advantage* go hand in hand: sovereignty-aligned systems will be first to clear the regulatory bar—and win user loyalty.

Having established the core spectrum of sovereignty, we now turn to how these interface features are instantiated in adaptive, context-aware user controls and real-world deployments (§5)
