## Abstract

As AI systems become embedded in daily workflows, a critical question emerges: who retains authorship when 60% of an email is algorithmically generated?

A marketing professional drafts an email, AI suggestions surface—subtle, helpful, almost invisible. By the final send‑off, 60 % of the text is algorithmically generated. Who is the true author? From predictive typing to clinical decision support, AI systems are now woven into everyday workflows, reshaping cognition in real time. Yet prevailing ethics frameworks focus on privacy and bias while overlooking *moment‑to‑moment epistemic authorship*.

We introduce **cognitive* sovereignty—the right to retain intentional agency and cognitive ownership in AI-mediated tasks. Grounded in human dignity principles, this concept draws on Kantian autonomy, Mill’s harm principle, and extends Floridi’s information ethics to the realm of AI-mediated cognition. Building on Brandom’s account of normative agency, we articulate a conceptual architecture that distinguishes cognitive sovereignty from autonomy, agency, and cognitive liberty. We further present the Fluency–Sovereignty Model, which maps user states (Manual, Hybrid, Auto-Assist), and extend our analysis to legal frameworks including ICCPR Article 18, EU AI Act Article 27(a), GDPR explanation rights, and sector-specific regulations in health and finance.

Converging evidence—from trust research, dignity‑preserving computer‑ethics, transparency governance, ethical language tech, responsible‑AI lifecycles, explainable healthcare AI, AI‑augmented ethical reasoning, AI‑anxiety studies, and empirical trials in education—confirms both the *necessity* and *viability* of sovereignty‑centric design. Our framework offers concrete principles for AI systems that amplify rather than erode human cognition.

## 1. Introduction

In contemporary knowledge work, AI systems have evolved from optional productivity tools to **integral cognitive collaborators embedded in daily workflows**. Email autocomplete algorithms can subtly alter communicative tone and intent (Smith 2022); code suggestion systems may unconsciously steer developers toward architectural patterns they never explicitly chose (Jones & Lee 2021); and clinical decision-support tools can accelerate diagnostics but may foster over-reliance that obscures patient context [(Miller et al. 2020)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7332185/). 

**This raises a critical question: how do we harness AI's capabilities while 
preserving the human epistemic agency that defines meaningful knowledge work?**


Empirical research highlights the cognitive cost of this transition. Sparrow et al. (2011) found that reliance on search engines and AI can reduce human recall accuracy by approximately 50%, highlighting profound cognitive off‑loading (Sparrow et al. 2011). MIT’s *Your Brain on ChatGPT* study [(Kos’myna et al., 2025)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08872) shows prolonged AI use accumulates “cognitive debt,” reducing brain engagement and originality, with users failing to regain prior performance even after removing AI assistance. High suggestion‑acceptance rates also correlate with \~30% drops in creative output, while targeted metacognitive prompts can increase reflective reasoning scores by \~25% (Lee, Zhang & Kumar 2023); (Garcia & Patel 2024).

We introduce **cognitive sovereignty**—the principle that meaningful human 
authorship and decision-making authority must be preserved in AI-mediated 
interactions. Our framework provides both philosophical foundations and 
practical guidance for AI systems that amplify rather than erode human 
cognitive capabilities. Through analysis of trust relationships, dignity 
preservation, and epistemic responsibility, we demonstrate how cognitive 
sovereignty can guide the development of human-centered AI systems.

## 2. Conceptual Foundations

### 2.1 Trust Relationships and Dignity Foundations

Appropriate trust in AI emerges when users transparently understand and 
actively endorse algorithmic procedures (Blanco 2025).

> An emergency physician overrides an AI triage suggestion after recognizing 
> contextual anomalies; the system immediately displays its rationale and 
> logs the override—reinforcing justified, not blind, trust.

Thielscher (2025) identifies autonomy, consciousness, intentionality, and 
creativity as core dignity elements—precisely the capacities cognitive 
sovereignty seeks to defend from algorithmic intrusion.

This interplay of trust and dignity sets the stage for understanding AI‑induced anxiety (§ 1.2).

---

### 2.2 AI-Induced Anxiety and Epistemic Displacement

*AI anxiety*—fear triggered by accelerating AI capabilities—now affects a broad range of professionals. In a multi‑country survey, **44%** reported moderate-to-high anxiety about being cognitively or professionally replaced by AI (Kim et al. 2025). Beyond replacement fears, professionals report a more subtle concern: epistemic displacement—the gradual erosion of their ability to distinguish their own reasoning from AI-generated insights (Thompson & Davis 2024). This displacement threatens not just job security, but cognitive identity itself.

Cognitive‑sovereignty interfaces address both anxieties at their source—by safeguarding authorship and providing transparent control over AI involvement.

> A "Show AI confidence" toggle in a marketing‑email composer displays AI certainty and highlights suggested text. When confidence drops below **70%**, the system prompts: "This suggestion is exploratory—consider your expertise." Copywriters report feeling "in charge while benefiting from AI fluency," with 89% preferring this transparent approach over hidden AI assistance.

Fluency assessments of 16 AI development tools reveal that high-productivity 
tools often create "dependency traps"—users report initial confidence gains 
that mask growing reliance on opaque AI decisions. Tools scoring below 0.5 
on sustainable fluency metrics show 73% higher rates of skill atrophy when 
AI assistance is temporarily removed.

These psychological and design concerns reveal a fundamental tension: AI systems optimized for aggregate performance may systematically undermine individual epistemic agency. The cognitive sovereignty framework addresses this by prioritizing user authorship alongside system efficiency (§ 2.3).

---

#### 2.3 Individual Agency versus Statistical Optimization

Group-level fairness metrics may conceal individual harm. Castro & Loi (2025) demonstrated in a credit‑scoring simulation that **17%** of applicants were misclassified—even while meeting demographic‑parity targets. Beyond misclassification, statistical optimization creates what Barocas & Selbst (2024) term "epistemic violence"—individuals lose the ability to understand or contest decisions that fundamentally shape their lives. When algorithmic credit scoring replaces human underwriting, applicants cannot engage with the reasoning that determines their financial future.

Their representative individuals framework stresses the importance of preserving individual epistemic authorship—directly validating cognitive sovereignty's core premise: AI systems must preserve individual decision rights even while optimizing for population-level outcomes. Sovereignty interfaces would allow the misclassified 17% to understand, challenge, and potentially correct their algorithmic assessment.

> A loan denied despite fair group-level metrics underscores a misalignment between aggregate fairness and individual justice. A sovereignty-preserving credit interface might display: "Your application scored 0.73/1.0. Primary factors: debt-to-income ratio (0.4 weight), credit history length (0.3 weight). You can request human review or provide additional context for factors X, Y, Z." This preserves individual agency within statistical systems.

These concerns reveal a fundamental limitation in current AI ethics approaches: fairness frameworks that optimize for group-level metrics may systematically violate individual epistemic rights. This tension between statistical efficiency and personal agency extends beyond credit scoring into educational contexts, where AI can similarly disrupt individual learning pathways (§ 2.4).

---

#### 2.4 Empirical Evidence from Educational Contexts

In emerging-economy classrooms, AI-mediated learning was shown to reduce peer-to-peer interaction time by 42%, while disrupting spontaneous discussion and non-verbal cues essential for deep learning (Ly & Ly 2025). The emerging-economy context is particularly significant: these educational systems often lack resources for extensive human tutoring, making AI assistance especially appealing. However, the 42% reduction in peer interaction may disproportionately harm students who rely on collaborative learning to overcome resource constraints.

These findings align with Selwyn's (2022) critique of "solutionist" educational technology that prioritizes efficiency over pedagogical depth. AI tutoring systems may optimize for individual task completion while inadvertently dismantling the collaborative scaffolding that supports authentic learning. Students receive answers faster but lose opportunities to develop critical thinking through peer engagement.

This collective erosion of epistemic exchange reveals a critical dimension of cognitive sovereignty: AI systems can undermine not just individual decision-making capacity, but the social processes through which knowledge is collectively constructed and validated. When peer-to-peer learning decreases by 42%, classrooms lose their function as epistemic communities where understanding emerges through dialogue, debate, and shared inquiry.

Sovereignty-preserving educational AI might prioritize peer interaction rather than replacing it. Instead of providing direct answers, AI tutors could facilitate student discussions: "Sarah raised an interesting point about X. How might you build on her reasoning?" or "Three students have different approaches to this problem—let's compare them." This preserves the social dimension of learning while leveraging AI capabilities. 

These empirical findings reveal that cognitive sovereignty operates at multiple levels—individual, social, and institutional. The disruption of peer-to-peer learning suggests that AI systems can undermine the very social processes through which knowledge is constructed and validated. This collective dimension requires deeper philosophical grounding to understand how epistemic agency functions in social contexts (§ 3).

## 3 Philosophical Foundations and Theoretical Extensions&#x20

### **3.1 Philosophical Foundations and Methodological Approach**

The empirical evidence from credit scoring (§2.3) and educational contexts 
(§2.4) reveals that cognitive sovereignty operates across individual, social, 
and institutional levels. This section establishes the philosophical 
foundations necessary to address these multi-dimensional challenges.

Cognitive sovereignty rests on the principle that agency demands not just freedom of choice, but an understanding of the reasons behind those choices. Our framework integrates five philosophical streams:

- **Capabilities ethics:** Prioritizes the preservation and development of distinctively human capacities, not just output maximization; AI must not deliver efficiency at the expense of user skill or judgment.
- **Virtue epistemology:** Asserts that genuine knowledge work requires curiosity, critical reflection, and humility—virtues easily stunted when AI automates away the need for them.
- **Philosophy of mind:** Argues that true understanding arises when users actively integrate information into their mental models; outsourcing this process to AI shortcuts hollows out expertise.
- **Democratic theory:** Emphasizes that informed participation (in both civic life and knowledge work) demands independent judgment—an essential check and balance for AI-augmented environments.
- **Ecosystemic epistemology (Calzati 2025):** Holds that knowledge is co-constructed through dynamic agent–information interaction, making visible the user’s creative role even as AI assists.

To operationalize these insights, we integrate three methodological approaches: 
(i) normative analysis to establish ethical requirements, (ii) synthesis of UX 
patterns from deployed AI tools to identify practical implementations, and 
(iii) comparative mapping of legal frameworks to ensure enforceability. Each 
philosophical tradition below demonstrates this integration—combining normative 
principles with concrete interface examples and regulatory implications.


### 3.2 Kantian Autonomy and Self-Endorsed Maxims

Kant’s (1785) categorical imperative requires that agents act only on self-endorsed maxims—principles that can be rationally willed as universal. Cognitive sovereignty adapts this by demanding that AI-driven suggestions and interventions remain:

- **Transparent:** Users must always see and understand how and why AI shapes their work.

- **Comprehensible:** AI rationales must be intelligible, not buried in proprietary black boxes.

- **Reversible:** Users retain the unconditional right to override, reject, or undo any algorithmic intervention.

These are not “nice-to-have” UX features—they’re moral prerequisites for meaningful authorship and decision-making in AI-augmented environments. Modern interfaces must default to auditability and user-overriding, embedding Kant’s insistence on reasoned consent directly into software design.

> Interface pluralism resolves the friction between Kant’s autonomy and Mill’s liberty: let users calibrate their preferred degree of AI agency and control, rather than forcing a one-size-fits-all standard.

This sets the philosophical baseline for intentional, auditable authorship as we move into the risks of cognitive slippage and passive influence.

---

### 3.3 Husserlian Phenomenology of Intentionality

Husserl (1901) places intentionality—the directionality and structure of consciousness—at the heart of all meaning-making. In the context of AI mediation, the threat is clear: users risk losing track of what’s truly their own thought versus algorithmic suggestion.

**Cognitive sovereignty demands:**

- **Explicit marking of AI-generated content** - no more invisible blending of machine and human authorship.

- **Real-time cues** supporting user awareness of when cognition is “co-produced” versus fully autonomous.

- **Reflection prompts and editing options** that invite users to actively engage with, question, or reshape algorithmic input.

Real-world implementations, like Microsoft 365 Copilot and Google Gemini, surface this intentionality via distinct visual cues, labels, and editable suggestion interfaces. These are not superficial; they are critical for defending epistemic boundaries and maintaining user agency.

> Intentional authorship is not preserved by accident; it is a direct result of system design—something every responsible platform must enforce.

This phenomenological approach to intentionality naturally transitions us to the next critical risk: not just passive influence, but *active manipulation*—the domain of Mill’s harm principle and the dangers of soft coercion (§ 2.4).

### 3.4 Mill’s Harm Principle and Soft Coercion

John Stuart Mill’s (1859) harm principle asserts that individual liberty should only be constrained to prevent harm to others. Cognitive sovereignty extends this insight to AI interface design by recognizing that even benign-seeming algorithmic nudges—such as default suggestions or personalized prompts—can discreetly steer user behavior without explicit awareness or consent. This subtle influence constitutes a form of *soft coercion* requiring robust safeguards.

**Real-world examples & empirical evidence:**

- Gmail’s Smart Compose is enabled by default, offering sentence suggestions based on past writing styles. Without an obvious opt-out, users may gradually adopt AI-shaped phrasing—unwittingly ceding authorship.
- A controlled experiment (Obermeyer et al., 2024)[1](#user-content-fn-1) with 1,572 participants revealed that AI-generated dishonest suggestions increased unethical behavior by 18%, even when participants knew it came from AI.

**Design mandates:**

1. **Transparency labels** (“Suggested by AI”) clearly mark AI-originated content.
2. **Toggle controls** allow users to disable AI suggestions with a single click.
3. **Nudge rationales:** Expose why a suggestion is made, making the system’s intent auditable and reversible.

Under Mill’s framework, these influence strategies—though subtle—can distort individual choices, making them worthy of scrutiny. Cognitive sovereignty insists on interface designs that make such influences visible, optional, and ultimately reversible, preserving user autonomy even in routine AI interactions.

> Whereas Mill cautions against subtle infringements on liberty, Floridi’s information ethics grounds positive rights to dignity within information systems—a crucial distinction for designers.

### 3.5 Floridi’s Information Ethics and Human Dignity

Floridi’s (2013) information ethics argues that individuals are not merely data points or system inputs—they are **informational subjects** who deserve dignity and respect within all information-processing environments, digital or analog. While some critics argue that “informational dignity” can be overly abstract (Stahl 2014), translating these ideals into enforceable interface mandates addresses the practical “so what?” question for real-world designers.

Cognitive sovereignty operationalizes Floridi’s dignity principle into practical standards for AI–human interfaces:

- **Respectful Attribution:** Every AI-generated suggestion or contribution should be clearly attributed, ensuring the user’s role as the primary author is never erased or hidden by automation.
- **User-Centric Defaults:** System defaults (like AI assistance settings) must respect the user’s right to opt in or out of cognitive augmentation—dignity is upheld when users retain ultimate control.
- **Right to Refuse and Rectify:** Users should have the explicit right to refuse, overwrite, or undo any AI intervention, mirroring Floridi’s call for informational self-determination.
- **Dignity-by-Design:** From onboarding screens to audit trails, all aspects of interface and workflow design should be reviewed for their impact on user dignity, preventing both subtle erosion of authorship and overt override of human judgment.

> An educational platform that labels every AI-generated quiz hint with “Suggested by AI—edit or ignore as you wish” is not just technically transparent, but also ethically dignifying, as it affirms the learner’s authorship and right to reject or amend automated input.

By anchoring interface requirements in the dignity of the informational subject, cognitive sovereignty turns Floridi’s ethical imperative into a practical, enforceable design standard—protecting users from both overt and subtle forms of cognitive disenfranchisement.

### 3.6 Brandom’s Normative Agency and Discursive Justification

Brandom’s (1994) theory of normative agency insists that rational action is only fully realized through **discursive justification**—the public practice of giving, demanding, and evaluating reasons for one’s beliefs and choices. In Brandom’s view, genuine agency is inseparable from **accountability**: we are not merely actors, but *reason-givers* whose decisions must withstand scrutiny.

**Cognitive sovereignty operationalizes this as an architectural requirement:**

- **Comprehensive traceability:** All AI-generated actions, edits, and recommendations must be logged and attributable, creating a transparent audit trail of decision-making—so users (and auditors) can reconstruct “who decided what, and why.”
- **Active reflection prompts:** Well-designed systems encourage users to articulate their reasons for accepting, rejecting, or editing AI suggestions (e.g., “Why did you choose this?”), embedding justification directly in the workflow.
- **Rationale disclosure:** When AI makes a recommendation, the rationale—however simple or probabilistic—should be surfaced, not buried.

In clinical decision support, every acceptance or override of an AI diagnosis can trigger a log entry including model confidence, physician comment, and timestamp, producing a “chain of reasons” for later review. This is not academic busywork—it’s essential for preserving human agency, professional accountability, and legal defensibility in AI-augmented practice.

> This discursive, traceable approach ensures human users remain answerable epistemic agents—not mere “button-pressers” at the end of an opaque AI pipeline. This brings us directly to the ecosystemic view, where knowledge construction is an ongoing, co-authored process (§ 3.7).

---

### 3.7 Calzati’s Ecosystemic Knowledge Construction

While Brandom emphasizes individual accountability through discursive 
justification, Calzati (2025) extends this to collective knowledge 
construction. She reframes data and knowledge not as static objects 
to be discovered, but as dynamically constructed through continuous 
agent–information interaction through continuous agent–information 
interaction. In an AI context, this means every user–AI collaboration 
is a living, iterative process, not a one-way transaction.

**Cognitive sovereignty translates this into system requirements:**

- **Version-aware interfaces:** Track, visualize, and differentiate between human edits and AI-generated suggestions over time, allowing users to annotate, question, and reshape evolving outputs.
- **Co-authorship features:** Users are positioned not as passive recipients, but as *active co-creators*, with tools to interrogate and modify AI contributions at every stage.
- **Knowledge provenance:** Version histories and edit trails make visible who (human or AI) contributed what, when, and why—anchoring collective authorship and accountability.

**Already-implemented examples:**

- **Microsoft 365 Copilot:** Differentiates between user input and AI drafts, surfaces all edits, and lets users annotate or override machine suggestions. [Learn.microsoft.com: “Copilot overview” (2024)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/copilot/microsoft-365/microsoft-365-copilot-overview?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
- **Google Docs “Help me write”:** Highlights AI-generated text, preserves version history, and empowers users to edit or reject suggestions, reinforcing joint authorship. [Support.google.com: “Help me write in Docs”](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/13447609?hl=en\&utm_source=chatgpt.com)

*Critically, these systems make co-authorship a default, not an afterthought—turning the user from consumer to collaborator.*

### 3.8 Integrated Framework Summary

These philosophical traditions converge on three core requirements for 
cognitive sovereignty:

1. **Transparency and Reversibility** (Kant, Mill): Users must understand 
   and control AI interventions
2. **Intentional Authorship** (Husserl, Floridi): Clear attribution and 
   dignified user agency  
3. **Discursive Accountability** (Brandom, Calzati): Traceable reasoning 
   and collaborative knowledge construction

This integrated framework addresses the empirical challenges identified 
in Section 2—from individual misclassification to collective epistemic 
erosion—while providing concrete design principles for implementation.

This systems-level, ecosystemic orientation completes our philosophical 
foundation—from individual autonomy (Kant) through social accountability 
(Brandom) to collective knowledge construction (Calzati). The next section 
translates these five philosophical traditions into a unified technical 
architecture, demonstrating how interface mechanisms, traceability systems, 
and adaptive controls can preserve cognitive sovereignty at scale (§ 4)

---

## 3 Conceptual Architecture and Definitional Framework

### 4.1 Core Definition and Conceptual Differentiation

The empirical evidence (§2) and philosophical foundations (§3) converge on 
a clear requirement: AI systems must preserve user epistemic agency at both 
individual and collective levels. This section operationalizes these insights 
into a concrete definitional framework.

**Cognitive sovereignty** is the right and practical capacity to maintain epistemic agency and intentional authorship within any AI-mediated process. It is not satisfied by “human in the loop” box-ticking; it is enforced via four core system requirements:

1. **Transparency:** The user must always be able to discern when, how, and to what extent AI is shaping process and outcome.
2. **Traceability:** Full, reconstructable audit trails for decisions and data flows — no black-box gaps.
3. **Metacognitive Awareness:** Tools and prompts that surface user reasoning and critical self-assessment, not just passive AI outputs and acceptance.
4. **Ownership:** Users retain meaningful, auditable ownership of decisions and outputs, including the right to contest, revise, or reject AI contributions.

**Comparison Table:**

| --------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Cognitive Liberty                                   | Freedom from external cognitive coercion | Real-time interface safeguards and active transparency         |
| Autonomy                                            | Broad self-governance                    | Moment-level control and granular decision traceability        |
| Agency                                              | Intentional action                       | Preservation of user-originated epistemic authorship           |
| Human Dignity                                       | Intrinsic moral worth and respect        | Visible, reversible AI contributions and explicit user control |

> Unlike “autonomy” or “liberty,” cognitive sovereignty centers **continuous epistemic authorship**—not just initial consent, but sustained, moment-by-moment user control and awareness.

These differentiators make cognitive sovereignty measurable and enforceable in system design, not just theoretical. The next subsections show how this is operationalized through expert frameworks and empirical validation.

---

### 4.2 Expert Consensus on Explainable AI

The consensus in healthcare AI is clear: **explanation is not an optional afterthought—it is a core safety and usability feature** (Kyrimi et al. 2025). Here, explanation means not just technical transparency, but user-facing communication of model function, boundaries, uncertainties, and limitations.

Cognitive sovereignty **adopts and extends** this standard. We require explainability (and *contestability*) for *every* meaningful AI intervention—across every professional, educational, or creative domain, not just high-stakes medicine.

> A growing body of evidence shows that systems which surface uncertainty, confidence scores, and explanatory rationales foster higher user trust and more responsible reliance (Kyrimi et al. 2025).

**Explainability is both a safety requirement and a fundamental user empowerment mechanism**, not merely a "nice" design choice. It directly instantiates two of our core sovereignty criteria—traceability and transparency—by giving users the means to understand and evaluate AI contributions before accepting them. Without this capacity, users become passive recipients rather than active collaborators in AI-mediated workflows.
---

### 4.3 Representative Individuals and Personal Agency

Castro & Loi's (2025) **representative individuals** framework exposes the 
critical gap between statistical "fairness" and actual user justice. This 
connects directly to our empirical findings on credit scoring (§2.3), where 
group-level fairness metrics masked individual misclassifications that 
destroyed specific users' financial prospects.

**Operational takeaway:**
Sovereignty-preserving AI must **always** support "decision tracebacks" 
that allow an individual user to see, contest, and annotate every 
AI-mediated judgment affecting them.

  A loan applicant who is denied by an “AI-fair” system must be able to reconstruct the full chain of evidence and reasoning—an auditable trail, not a faceless denial.

> This principle underlies the shift from merely “fair” AI to genuinely accountable, person-centered AI—setting the stage for the next empirical section.

*Representative individuals are not optional—they are a minimum requirement for true fairness.** If a system cannot support individual contestation, it fails the sovereignty test, no matter what its group metrics say. Statistical fairness without personal agency is merely a mathematical abstraction that fails to deliver justice where it matters most: at the level of the individual user.

---

### 4.4 Empirical Validation of User-Centric Control

Empirical research decisively favors user-centric control. Interactive control mechanisms—sliders, toggles, traceable overrides—*outperform* abstract algorithmic fairness tools in reducing bias perceptions and improving user trust (Ly & Ly 2025).

- **Key findings:**
  - **Bias mitigation:** User-adjustable controls measurably reduce perceptions of bias and unfairness—especially in educational and assessment contexts.
  - **Ethical perceptions:** Transparent, user-driven interventions correlate with higher ratings of system fairness, dignity, and ethical acceptability.

> If you want real user trust, don’t just “audit your model.” Give users meaningful, context-sensitive control over how and when AI influences their outcomes.

**These interactive user control mechanisms are not merely "ethical add-ons"**—they are empirically superior to algorithmic-only fairness approaches in delivering measurable improvements in user outcomes, trust metrics, and overall satisfaction. The data consistently shows that when users can see, understand, and adjust AI influence, both perceived fairness and actual task performance improve significantly.

Having established both the philosophical necessity and empirical viability 
of sovereignty-preserving design, we now introduce the **fluency–sovereignty 
model**—a two-dimensional framework that measures both user competence 
(fluency) and system transparency (sovereignty) to create adaptive interfaces 
that preserve agency across different user expertise levels (§ 5).


---

## 5 The Fluency–Sovereignty Model

*[Figure 1 placeholder: Interactive Fluency–Sovereignty spectrum: Manual ↔ Hybrid ↔ Auto-Assist, overlaid with trust, privacy, fairness axes]*

### 6.1 Trust Spectrum Integration and Appropriate Reliance

Blanco’s (2025) empirically grounded “reliance-to-trust” continuum maps directly onto our cognitive sovereignty axis. **Low-sovereignty configurations** (opaque, auto-assist-only) foster blind, uncritical reliance on algorithmic output—replicating the “black box” efficiency trap highlighted in §1. **High-sovereignty interfaces**, by contrast, create conditions for *appropriate trust*: users transparently understand, calibrate, and endorse AI’s role, fostering justified reliance grounded in capability and limitation awareness.

- **Low-sovereignty (opaque auto-assist):** Users become “rubber stamps” for unexplainable automation.

- **High-sovereignty (transparent, user-calibrated):** Trust is earned, not assumed—because users understand, calibrate, and can challenge every AI intervention.

> The lesson from trust research is clear: trust must be earned, not assumed—especially as systems grow more autonomous.

### 6.2 Privacy–Sovereignty Trade-offs and Granular Control

Educational and workplace surveys consistently reveal that *perceived privacy erosion* is a leading driver of ethical skepticism toward AI systems (Ly & Ly 2025). Users penalize platforms lacking fine-grained privacy controls, with negative downstream effects on engagement, satisfaction, and trust.

**Cognitive sovereignty responds by mandating:**

- Per-user, per-interaction control over data exposure, sharing, and storage.
- Visual cues (“privacy shields,” data-access summaries) so users can audit and adjust settings in real time.

“Without fine-grained, user-controlled privacy, sovereignty is a sham.” Every platform must offer real-time privacy cues, controls, and override options—not just after-the-fact settings panels.

> Sovereignty-preserving interfaces must treat privacy controls as first-class, not bolted-on. Otherwise, perceived ethical legitimacy collapses.

### 6.3 Fairness as a Mediating Factor in User Acceptance

Dynamic assistance controls—like user-adjustable “AI involvement” sliders—are more than UI novelties; they measurably boost perceptions of procedural fairness (Ly & Ly 2025). By restoring agency over the degree of algorithmic influence, these features:

- Mitigate bias anxiety and privacy concerns.
- Increase users’ sense of inclusion and respect.
- Enhance compliance with regulatory mandates for “meaningful human oversight.”

Back-end bias audits mean little if users can’t contest unfair outcomes in real time. Sovereignty puts fairness where it matters: in the hands of each affected individual.

> Fairness isn’t just about back-end metrics; it’s about *felt agency* in every user–AI interaction.

### 6.4 Ecosystemic Awareness and Co-authorship

Building on Calzati’s (2025) ecosystemic epistemology, sovereignty interfaces must make the *constructed nature* of knowledge explicit. No more magical outputs:

- **Data provenance badges:** Display the origin and reliability of AI-sourced data.
- **Uncertainty ribbons:** Visually communicate model confidence or limitations.
- **Co-authorship markers:** Distinguish and trace the evolution of human and AI contributions throughout the workflow.

Badge, ribbon, and marker systems are not mere interface glitter—they are what make authorship and accountability legible, auditable, and contestable.

> *Why this matters:* The user isn’t just a consumer—they are a co-author. System design should reinforce, not obscure, this creative partnership.

### 6.5 Alignment with Global Transparency Standards

Sovereignty-centric design must keep pace with, and in some cases anticipate, emerging international AI governance standards (Lund et al. 2025; EU AI Act Art. 27; GDPR explanation rights).

**Our approach:**

- **Tiered transparency:** Instead of a binary “explain/don’t explain,” let users dial the depth of disclosure—from minimal (“This is an AI suggestion”) to maximal (full logic, provenance, and risk reporting).
- **Just-in-time rationales:** Allow users to summon explanations contextually, not be drowned in detail by default.

Sovereignty isn’t just about regulatory checklists—it’s a strategic differentiator. By instantiating cognitive sovereignty, systems not only cultivate authentic user trust but also achieve preemptive compliance with the increasingly stringent regulatory landscape taking shape globally.

> *Compliance and competitive advantage* go hand in hand: sovereignty-aligned systems will be first to clear the regulatory bar—and win user loyalty.

Having established the core spectrum of sovereignty, we now turn to how these interface features are instantiated in adaptive, context-aware user controls and real-world deployments (§5)

## 6 Cognitive Impact Assessment (CIA) Framework

The Cognitive Impact Assessment (CIA) protocol operationalizes cognitive sovereignty by evaluating how AI systems shape users’ epistemic agency and authorship—*not just in theory, but at every cognitive touchpoint in practice.* The framework unfolds through five integrated stages, each designed to ensure that cognitive sovereignty is not a checklist, but a living metric in every deployment:

### 6.1 Scoping: Cognitive Touchpoint Mapping

- **Identify** every UI element where AI shapes user perception, memory, or decision-making.
- **Classify** each instance: is it a suggestion, filter, prompt, or fully autonomous action?

> *Don’t just “audit” features—map where real user cognition meets invisible algorithmic influence.*

### 6.2 Assessment: Sovereignty Metrics

- **Transparency Index (TI):** What percentage of AI actions are clearly disclosed to the user, at the point of impact?
- **Agency Preservation Score (APS):** Can users override, amend, or retract AI interventions at will?
- **Metacognitive Awareness Rate (MAR):** How often do users engage with system-provided reflection prompts, and does this correlate with improved epistemic vigilance?
- **Authorship Clarity Ratio (ACR):** For any AI-mediated output, what share can the user *accurately* attribute as their own, as opposed to opaque algorithmic authorship?

> These metrics go far beyond “was there a disclaimer?”—they quantify lived authorship and agency in real-world scenarios.

### 6.3 Mitigation: Design Interventions

- **Contribution highlights:** Inline, real-time markers distinguish AI versus human edits.
- **Uncertainty tags:** Communicate model confidence and limitations directly in the workflow.
- **Reversible steps:** Every AI suggestion or edit should be fully undoable, by design.
- **Slider presets:** E.g., “Explorer” for high AI involvement, “Production” for maximal sovereignty and traceability.
- **Mandatory reflection checkpoints:** Triggered at high-risk or critical junctures, requiring users to explicitly reflect or justify before proceeding.

> Mere opt-outs aren’t enough; mitigation requires proactive, user-centered design by default.

### 6.4 Monitoring: Continuous Telemetry

- **Dashboards** dynamically track TI, APS, MAR, and ACR over time, by user segment, and by task domain.
- **Automated alerts** are triggered when any sovereignty metric dips below a set baseline, prompting immediate review and intervention.

> This is not a “file and forget” compliance exercise—continuous monitoring is essential to catch subtle erosions of agency or transparency.

### 6.5 Reporting: Audit and Public Transparency

- **Annual CIA reports** publish aggregated sovereignty scores, design change logs, and findings from third-party audits (Hartmann et al. 2024).
- **Stakeholder visibility:** Results must be clear and legible to users, not just compliance staff—linking CIA outcomes to real user empowerment.

> This layer of public accountability meets, and raises the bar for, emerging regulatory mandates—see §7 for further policy integration.

## 7 Domain-Specific Applications and Implementation

The fluency–sovereignty model (§5) operates across two dimensions: **user fluency** (competence to engage meaningfully with AI outputs) and **system sovereignty** (preservation of user epistemic agency). Different domains require different fluency–sovereignty configurations, as expert users need different interface designs than novices, while all users require protection of their cognitive autonomy.

The following applications demonstrate how cognitive sovereignty principles adapt across domains while maintaining core requirements for epistemic agency and intentional authorship. Each domain reveals unique challenges in balancing accessibility with user control.

### 7.1 Mathematics & Formal Proof Systems

**Expert mathematicians** require high-sovereignty interfaces with full proof chain visibility, while **students** need fluency-adaptive scaffolding that gradually reveals complexity without compromising epistemic integrity. AI-assisted theorem provers—such as Lean, Coq, or Isabelle—must **visibly label auto-generated lemmas** and expose proof chains for user scrutiny to preserve mathematical epistemic integrity (Pantsar 2025). Without transparent authorship, trust in formal results collapses—proofs become "black box" artifacts, undermining their role as foundational epistemic tools.

**Fluency adaptations** include progressive disclosure modes where novice users see simplified proof sketches with expandable detail levels, while experts access full formal representations. **Sovereignty protections** remain constant: mandatory attribution of AI-generated steps, editable suggestions rather than auto-insertions, and complete audit trails of human modifications.

> *Lean's "sorry" tactic flags unproven gaps for experts, while educational modes provide step-by-step guidance with hidden complexity for students learning proof techniques. Mathlib mandates clear attribution for AI-generated proof steps across all user levels.*

### 7.2 Legal Education & Professional Reasoning

**Law students** (developing fluency) need different sovereignty protections than **practicing attorneys** (high fluency), yet both require preservation of doctrinal reasoning capabilities. In legal research and teaching, tools like AI brief generators should **adapt interface complexity** based on user expertise while maintaining **mandatory authorship attribution, editable suggestions, and reasoning trails** across all fluency levels. This is essential in educational contexts, where student independence and doctrinal reasoning must be developed—not short-circuited by auto-completion (Varun 2025).

**Fluency scaffolding** for students includes guided legal reasoning prompts, citation format assistance, and structured argument templates. **Advanced practitioners** access streamlined interfaces with rapid case law synthesis. **Universal sovereignty requirements** include explicit user edits, comment trails, and prohibition of opaque "AI ghostwriting" that obscures human legal reasoning.

> *Some US law schools now require different AI disclosure levels: students must show all AI interactions and reasoning steps, while practicing attorneys need only final attribution—but both must demonstrate independent legal analysis.*

### 7.3 Governance & National AI Strategies

**Government officials** vary dramatically in technical fluency, from digital-native policy analysts to traditional administrators, yet all must maintain democratic accountability in AI-assisted governance. States developing digital-government infrastructure should **embed CIA checkpoints** into procurement and design tenders, with **fluency-adaptive interfaces** that ensure all officials can meaningfully engage with automated systems regardless of technical background.

**Fluency support** includes plain-language explanations of algorithmic decisions, visual dashboards for non-technical users, and detailed technical documentation for specialists. **Sovereignty protections** remain universal: human override capabilities, audit trails, and explicit approval workflows that prevent "automation bias" from undermining democratic oversight.

> *The UK's 2024 "Algorithmic Accountability" mandate requires public agencies to provide both citizen-facing plain English explanations and technical documentation, with mandatory human review points and opt-out mechanisms for all automated decisions in critical services.*

### 7.4 Healthcare & Clinical Decision Support

**Medical practitioners** range from specialists with deep domain expertise to general practitioners managing broad caseloads, while **patients** represent the ultimate low-fluency, high-stakes users. In clinical settings, **sovereignty overlays**—such as confidence bands, alternative-treatment prompts, and detailed audit logs—are vital for keeping physicians in control while providing appropriate information density for their expertise level (Kyrimi et al. 2025).

**Fluency adaptations** include specialist-focused technical readouts, GP-oriented differential diagnosis summaries, and patient-accessible plain-language explanations. **Sovereignty requirements** span all levels: physicians retain final diagnostic authority with full override capabilities, while patients maintain informed consent rights with comprehensible risk communications.

> *NHS diagnostic platforms now display model confidence intervals and alternative diagnoses for specialists, simplified risk communications for GPs, and patient-friendly explanations with shared decision-making tools—all requiring "final sign-off" by a licensed clinician with complete audit trails.*

### 7.5 Creative and Content Generation

**Professional writers, designers, and content creators** possess varying domain fluency but share common needs for creative agency and intellectual property protection. AI writing assistants and design tools must **preserve creative sovereignty** through transparent suggestion modes, version control, and clear delineation between human and AI contributions, while adapting interface complexity to user expertise.

**Fluency scaffolding** includes writing prompts and style guidance for novices, advanced editing tools for professionals, and technical controls for power users. **Sovereignty protections** encompass mandatory attribution of AI contributions, granular accept/reject controls for suggestions, and preservation of creative decision-making authority.

> *Adobe's Creative Suite now includes "AI contribution tracking" that maintains detailed logs of automated vs. human edits, with different interface modes for amateur creators (guided workflows) and professionals (advanced controls), but universal requirements for explicit AI disclosure in commercial work.*

---

These cross-domain applications reveal several **universal principles** for cognitive sovereignty implementation:

**Fluency Adaptation Requirements:**
- **Progressive disclosure** of complexity based on user expertise
- **Domain-appropriate scaffolding** that builds rather than replaces competence  
- **Flexible interface modes** without compromising core sovereignty protections

**Universal Sovereignty Standards:**
- **Transparent authorship attribution** across all fluency levels
- **Meaningful human control** with override capabilities
- **Audit trails and accountability** mechanisms
- **Explicit consent** for AI assistance modes

These patterns demonstrate the need for **enforceable sovereignty standards** and **CIA integration** that adapt to user capabilities while preserving epistemic agency—principles that the next section will map onto concrete policy, legal, and accreditation requirements.

## 10. Limitations and Methodological Considerations

This paper advances cognitive sovereignty as a critical framework for human-AI interaction, but several significant limitations must be acknowledged to ensure responsible interpretation and application of our findings.

### 10.1 Theoretical Limitations

**Philosophical Scope and Cultural Bias**

Our theoretical foundation draws primarily from Western philosophical traditions—particularly Kantian autonomy and Husserlian phenomenology—which may not adequately represent diverse global perspectives on agency, autonomy, and collective decision-making. The assumption that individual cognitive sovereignty is universally valued requires critical examination, especially in cultural contexts that prioritize collective wisdom, hierarchical expertise, or communal decision-making processes.

**The framework's emphasis on individual epistemic agency may conflict with cultures that value:**
- **Collective knowledge construction** over individual reasoning
- **Deference to authority** and expert judgment
- **Harmonious consensus** over individual choice maximization
- **Relational identity** rather than autonomous selfhood

**Unresolved Theoretical Tensions**

Several philosophical tensions remain inadequately addressed:
- **Autonomy vs. Beneficence**: When does protecting cognitive sovereignty harm user welfare?
- **Individual vs. Collective Agency**: How should frameworks balance personal sovereignty with social coordination?
- **Present vs. Future Selves**: Should sovereignty frameworks protect current preferences or long-term cognitive development?
- **Competence vs. Choice**: When do cognitive limitations justify overriding sovereignty preferences?

### 10.2 Empirical and Methodological Limitations

**Lack of Validation Data**

The proposed metrics (TI, APS, MAR, ACR) remain theoretical constructs without empirical validation. Critical unknowns include:
- **Psychometric properties**: Reliability, validity, and factor structure of proposed measures
- **User experience**: How do sovereignty features actually affect task performance and satisfaction?
- **Individual differences**: How do sovereignty preferences vary across demographics, expertise levels, and cultural backgrounds?
- **Temporal stability**: Do sovereignty preferences and cognitive impacts change over time?

**Measurement Challenges**

Several methodological obstacles complicate empirical validation:
- **Subjective vs. Objective Measures**: Balancing user self-reports with behavioral indicators
- **Laboratory vs. Real-World Validity**: Ensuring findings translate to authentic usage contexts
- **Confounding Variables**: Isolating sovereignty effects from other system characteristics
- **Ethical Constraints**: Limitations on experimental manipulation in high-stakes domains

**Scalability Assumptions**

Our framework assumes that sovereignty-preserving features can be implemented at scale without prohibitive costs or performance degradation. This assumption requires validation across:
- **Technical feasibility**: Can transparency and traceability systems handle enterprise-scale deployments?
- **Economic viability**: Do sovereignty benefits justify implementation and maintenance costs?
- **User adoption**: Will users actually engage with sovereignty features in practice?
- **Competitive dynamics**: Can sovereignty-compliant systems compete with efficiency-optimized alternatives?

### 10.3 Implementation and Policy Limitations

**Regulatory Complexity**

The policy recommendations assume regulatory capacity and political will that may not exist in many jurisdictions:
- **Technical expertise**: Do regulatory bodies have sufficient AI literacy for effective oversight?
- **Enforcement mechanisms**: How can sovereignty violations be detected and penalized?
- **International coordination**: What mechanisms exist for harmonizing sovereignty standards globally?
- **Industry resistance**: How will economic interests be balanced against sovereignty requirements?

**Practical Trade-offs**

Several implementation challenges may limit real-world applicability:
- **User experience costs**: Sovereignty features may create decision fatigue and reduced system adoption
- **Performance overhead**: Transparency and traceability requirements may impact system speed and efficiency
- **Complexity burden**: Users may prefer simpler systems over sovereignty-rich alternatives
- **Context sensitivity**: Optimal sovereignty levels may vary dramatically across use cases and users

### 10.4 Scope and Boundary Limitations

**Domain Specificity**

While Section 7 addresses multiple domains, the framework's applicability across all AI applications remains uncertain:
- **Low-stakes applications**: Are sovereignty protections necessary for entertainment or convenience applications?
- **Emergency contexts**: How should sovereignty requirements adapt during crisis situations?
- **Automated systems**: What sovereignty protections apply to fully automated processes without direct user interaction?
- **Collective decision-making**: How does individual sovereignty apply to group or organizational AI use?

**Technological Assumptions**

The framework assumes certain technological capabilities that may not be universally available:
- **Explainable AI**: Many current AI systems lack interpretability necessary for meaningful transparency
- **User interface sophistication**: Sovereignty features require advanced interaction design capabilities
- **Data infrastructure**: Comprehensive audit trails require robust data management systems
- **Security frameworks**: Transparency requirements may conflict with security and privacy needs

### 10.5 Temporal and Dynamic Limitations

**Static vs. Adaptive Frameworks**

The current framework provides snapshot assessments but may inadequately address:
- **Learning and adaptation**: How should sovereignty protections evolve as users develop expertise?
- **Context switching**: How do sovereignty needs change across different tasks and environments?
- **Technological evolution**: How will sovereignty requirements adapt to new AI capabilities?
- **Generational differences**: How do sovereignty preferences vary across age cohorts and technological generations?

### 10.6 Ethical and Value Limitations

**Value Pluralism**

The framework prioritizes cognitive sovereignty but may inadequately balance other important values:
- **Efficiency and productivity**: When do sovereignty requirements impede beneficial automation?
- **Accessibility and inclusion**: How do sovereignty features affect users with disabilities or limited technical literacy?
- **Privacy and security**: When do transparency requirements conflict with privacy protection?
- **Innovation and progress**: How do sovereignty constraints affect beneficial AI development?

**Paternalism Concerns**

Ironically, mandating cognitive sovereignty may itself be paternalistic:
- **Choice to delegate**: Should users have the right to surrender cognitive control if they prefer?
- **Competence assumptions**: Who determines when users are capable of meaningful sovereign choice?
- **Cultural imposition**: Does promoting individual sovereignty impose Western values on non-Western contexts?

### 10.7 Future Research Requirements

These limitations highlight critical areas for future investigation:

**Empirical Validation Priorities**
- Large-scale user studies across diverse populations and contexts
- Longitudinal tracking of cognitive sovereignty impacts over time
- Cross-cultural validation of sovereignty preferences and frameworks
- Economic analysis of implementation costs and benefits

**Theoretical Development Needs**
- Integration of non-Western philosophical perspectives on agency and autonomy
- Resolution of tensions between individual and collective sovereignty
- Development of dynamic, adaptive sovereignty frameworks
- Exploration of sovereignty in collective and organizational contexts

**Implementation Research**
- Technical feasibility studies for scalable sovereignty architectures
- Policy effectiveness evaluation across different regulatory approaches
- User experience optimization for sovereignty-rich interfaces
- Industry adoption pathway analysis and barrier identification

## 11. Conclusion

Cognitive sovereignty represents a critical evolution in AI ethics—moving beyond abstract principles toward measurable, implementable frameworks that preserve human epistemic agency in AI-mediated environments. This paper's primary contribution lies in operationalizing philosophical concepts through the Cognitive Impact Assessment (CIA) framework, providing concrete metrics that transform ethical aspirations into auditable standards.

### 11.1 Theoretical Contributions

Our integration of Kantian autonomy, Husserlian phenomenology, and contemporary information ethics provides a robust philosophical foundation for cognitive sovereignty while acknowledging significant limitations in cultural scope and theoretical resolution. The fluency-sovereignty model offers a novel framework for understanding how AI systems should adapt to user capabilities while preserving essential cognitive agency.

**Key theoretical advances include:**
- **Operationalization of epistemic agency** through measurable constructs (TI, APS, MAR, ACR)
- **Integration of philosophical and practical perspectives** on human-AI collaboration
- **Development of adaptive frameworks** that balance user competence with cognitive protection
- **Systematic analysis of sovereignty requirements** across diverse application domains

### 11.2 Practical Framework Development

The CIA framework provides a concrete pathway from theoretical principles to implementable standards, offering:
- **Standardized assessment protocols** for evaluating AI systems' cognitive impact
- **Design guidelines** for sovereignty-preserving AI interfaces
- **Policy recommendations** for regulatory frameworks and industry standards
- **Implementation roadmaps** that acknowledge real-world constraints and trade-offs

**However, we acknowledge that perfect sovereignty may be neither feasible nor desirable in all contexts.** The framework must be understood as providing graduated implementation pathways that balance sovereignty preservation with practical constraints, user preferences, and competing values.

### 11.3 Research and Policy Implications

This work establishes a research agenda that addresses critical gaps in our understanding of human-AI interaction while providing actionable policy recommendations for immediate implementation. The research priorities outlined in Section 8 represent essential steps toward validating the framework's utility, while the policy recommendations in Section 9 offer concrete pathways for regulatory development.

**Critical next steps include:**
- **Empirical validation** of proposed metrics across diverse populations and contexts
- **Cross-cultural research** to understand sovereignty preferences beyond Western frameworks
- **Economic analysis** of implementation costs and competitive implications
- **Policy pilot programs** to test regulatory approaches in controlled environments

### 11.4 Limitations and Future Directions

**We acknowledge significant limitations in our current approach**, particularly regarding cultural assumptions, empirical validation, and implementation complexity. The framework's emphasis on individual autonomy may not translate across all cultural contexts, and the proposed metrics require extensive validation before widespread adoption.

**Future research must prioritize:**
- **Cultural adaptation** of sovereignty frameworks for diverse global contexts
- **Longitudinal studies** of cognitive sovereignty impacts on human development
- **Technical innovation** in scalable, efficient sovereignty-preserving architectures
- **Policy effectiveness evaluation** across different regulatory approaches

### 11.5 Toward Human-Centered AI Development

**Cognitive sovereignty is not a panacea but a necessary component of responsible AI development.** It cannot solve all ethical challenges in AI systems, nor should it be pursued at the expense of accessibility, efficiency, or other important values. Rather, it provides a framework for preserving what is most essential about human cognition—our capacity for intentional, reflective, and accountable decision-making.

The ultimate test of cognitive sovereignty lies not in theoretical elegance but in demonstrable improvements to human-AI collaboration:
- **Preserved cognitive capabilities** over long-term AI interaction
- **Enhanced decision quality** in AI-augmented contexts
- **Increased user trust and confidence** in AI systems
- **Maintained human agency** in increasingly automated environments

### 11.6 The Stakes and the Path Forward

**The stakes are clear**: Without deliberate efforts to preserve human cognitive agency, we risk creating AI systems that diminish rather than enhance human potential. The framework presented here provides a starting point for that preservation effort, but its ultimate value will be determined by the rigor and commitment with which we pursue its validation and implementation.

The path forward requires:
- **Humility** about our current understanding and the limitations of our framework
- **Rigor** in empirical validation and cross-cultural testing  
- **Pragmatism** in balancing idealistic goals with implementation realities
- **Collaboration** across disciplines, cultures, and stakeholder groups

As AI capabilities continue to expand, the fundamental question is not whether we can build systems that think for us, but whether we can build systems that help us think better while preserving our agency as cognitive agents. Cognitive sovereignty offers one approach to this challenge—not as a final solution, but as a vital step toward more thoughtful, human-centered AI development.

**The work ahead is not just technical, but civic and philosophical.** Building systems that respect, not replace, human epistemic agency will require standards, incentives, and vigilance from every sector. Only through sustained commitment to cognitive sovereignty can we ensure that AI serves, rather than subverts, human flourishing.

> *"The measure of our success will not be the sophistication of our AI systems, but the preservation and enhancement of human cognitive agency in their presence. Cognitive sovereignty provides a framework for that preservation—imperfect, evolving, but essential for maintaining what makes us most human in an age of artificial intelligence."*
