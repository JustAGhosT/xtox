## 7 Domain-Specific Applications and Implementation

The fluency–sovereignty model (§5) operates across two dimensions: **user fluency** (competence to engage meaningfully with AI outputs) and **system sovereignty** (preservation of user epistemic agency). Different domains require different fluency–sovereignty configurations, as expert users need different interface designs than novices, while all users require protection of their cognitive autonomy.

The following applications demonstrate how cognitive sovereignty principles adapt across domains while maintaining core requirements for epistemic agency and intentional authorship. Each domain reveals unique challenges in balancing accessibility with user control.

### 7.1 Mathematics & Formal Proof Systems

**Expert mathematicians** require high-sovereignty interfaces with full proof chain visibility, while **students** need fluency-adaptive scaffolding that gradually reveals complexity without compromising epistemic integrity. AI-assisted theorem provers—such as Lean, Coq, or Isabelle—must **visibly label auto-generated lemmas** and expose proof chains for user scrutiny to preserve mathematical epistemic integrity (Pantsar 2025). Without transparent authorship, trust in formal results collapses—proofs become "black box" artifacts, undermining their role as foundational epistemic tools.

**Fluency adaptations** include progressive disclosure modes where novice users see simplified proof sketches with expandable detail levels, while experts access full formal representations. **Sovereignty protections** remain constant: mandatory attribution of AI-generated steps, editable suggestions rather than auto-insertions, and complete audit trails of human modifications.

> *Lean's "sorry" tactic flags unproven gaps for experts, while educational modes provide step-by-step guidance with hidden complexity for students learning proof techniques. Mathlib mandates clear attribution for AI-generated proof steps across all user levels.*

### 7.2 Legal Education & Professional Reasoning

**Law students** (developing fluency) need different sovereignty protections than **practicing attorneys** (high fluency), yet both require preservation of doctrinal reasoning capabilities. In legal research and teaching, tools like AI brief generators should **adapt interface complexity** based on user expertise while maintaining **mandatory authorship attribution, editable suggestions, and reasoning trails** across all fluency levels. This is essential in educational contexts, where student independence and doctrinal reasoning must be developed—not short-circuited by auto-completion (Varun 2025).

**Fluency scaffolding** for students includes guided legal reasoning prompts, citation format assistance, and structured argument templates. **Advanced practitioners** access streamlined interfaces with rapid case law synthesis. **Universal sovereignty requirements** include explicit user edits, comment trails, and prohibition of opaque "AI ghostwriting" that obscures human legal reasoning.

> *Some US law schools now require different AI disclosure levels: students must show all AI interactions and reasoning steps, while practicing attorneys need only final attribution—but both must demonstrate independent legal analysis.*

### 7.3 Governance & National AI Strategies

**Government officials** vary dramatically in technical fluency, from digital-native policy analysts to traditional administrators, yet all must maintain democratic accountability in AI-assisted governance. States developing digital-government infrastructure should **embed CIA checkpoints** into procurement and design tenders, with **fluency-adaptive interfaces** that ensure all officials can meaningfully engage with automated systems regardless of technical background.

**Fluency support** includes plain-language explanations of algorithmic decisions, visual dashboards for non-technical users, and detailed technical documentation for specialists. **Sovereignty protections** remain universal: human override capabilities, audit trails, and explicit approval workflows that prevent "automation bias" from undermining democratic oversight.

> *The UK's 2024 "Algorithmic Accountability" mandate requires public agencies to provide both citizen-facing plain English explanations and technical documentation, with mandatory human review points and opt-out mechanisms for all automated decisions in critical services.*

### 7.4 Healthcare & Clinical Decision Support

**Medical practitioners** range from specialists with deep domain expertise to general practitioners managing broad caseloads, while **patients** represent the ultimate low-fluency, high-stakes users. In clinical settings, **sovereignty overlays**—such as confidence bands, alternative-treatment prompts, and detailed audit logs—are vital for keeping physicians in control while providing appropriate information density for their expertise level (Kyrimi et al. 2025).

**Fluency adaptations** include specialist-focused technical readouts, GP-oriented differential diagnosis summaries, and patient-accessible plain-language explanations. **Sovereignty requirements** span all levels: physicians retain final diagnostic authority with full override capabilities, while patients maintain informed consent rights with comprehensible risk communications.

> *NHS diagnostic platforms now display model confidence intervals and alternative diagnoses for specialists, simplified risk communications for GPs, and patient-friendly explanations with shared decision-making tools—all requiring "final sign-off" by a licensed clinician with complete audit trails.*

### 7.5 Creative and Content Generation

**Professional writers, designers, and content creators** possess varying domain fluency but share common needs for creative agency and intellectual property protection. AI writing assistants and design tools must **preserve creative sovereignty** through transparent suggestion modes, version control, and clear delineation between human and AI contributions, while adapting interface complexity to user expertise.

**Fluency scaffolding** includes writing prompts and style guidance for novices, advanced editing tools for professionals, and technical controls for power users. **Sovereignty protections** encompass mandatory attribution of AI contributions, granular accept/reject controls for suggestions, and preservation of creative decision-making authority.

> *Adobe's Creative Suite now includes "AI contribution tracking" that maintains detailed logs of automated vs. human edits, with different interface modes for amateur creators (guided workflows) and professionals (advanced controls), but universal requirements for explicit AI disclosure in commercial work.*

---

These cross-domain applications reveal several **universal principles** for cognitive sovereignty implementation:

**Fluency Adaptation Requirements:**
- **Progressive disclosure** of complexity based on user expertise
- **Domain-appropriate scaffolding** that builds rather than replaces competence  
- **Flexible interface modes** without compromising core sovereignty protections

**Universal Sovereignty Standards:**
- **Transparent authorship attribution** across all fluency levels
- **Meaningful human control** with override capabilities
- **Audit trails and accountability** mechanisms
- **Explicit consent** for AI assistance modes

These patterns demonstrate the need for **enforceable sovereignty standards** and **CIA integration** that adapt to user capabilities while preserving epistemic agency—principles that the next section will map onto concrete policy, legal, and accreditation requirements.
