## What is Cognitive Sovereignty?

As AI tools become embedded in daily work, a critical question emerges: **How do we harness AI's capabilities while preserving the human thinking that defines meaningful knowledge work?**

Our research investigates **cognitive sovereignty**—the right to retain intentional agency and cognitive ownership in AI-mediated tasks. We're studying how different AI tools affect users' long-term cognitive capabilities, decision-making independence, and professional development.

## Study Objectives

### Primary Research Questions:
1. **How do different AI tools impact users' cognitive capabilities over time?**
2. **Which design features best preserve human epistemic agency while enabling productive AI collaboration?**
3. **What are the long-term effects of AI assistance on skill development and professional competence?**

### Key Measurements:
- **Cognitive Impact Assessment (CIA 2.0):** How AI systems affect reasoning independence and epistemic agency
- **Sustainable Fluency (Fluency 2.0):** Whether AI assistance creates genuine skill development or temporary performance enhancement
- **User Experience Metrics:** Satisfaction, trust calibration, and perceived cognitive ownership
