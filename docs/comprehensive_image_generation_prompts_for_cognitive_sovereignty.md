# Comprehensive Image Generation Prompts: Cognitive Sovereignty Implementation

## 1. CIA 2.0 × Fluency 2.0 Diagnostic Quadrant Diagram

**Prompt:**
Create a modern, visually striking quadrant diagram titled:
**"CIA 2.0 × Fluency 2.0: Human–AI Partnership Diagnostic Quadrant"**.

- **Axes:**

  - X axis: User Control (Low → High)
  - Y axis: System Transparency (Low → High)

- **Quadrants:**

  - **Q1 (Top Right, Green): OPTIMAL ZONE**
    - Label: "Sustainable Mastery"
    - Icon: Green star
    - Examples: JetBrains AI Assistant, Tabnine Enterprise, Claude, Cody, Codeium
    - Example CIA/Fluency scores (e.g., CIA 0.92, Fluency 1.27)
  - **Q2 (Top Left, Orange): EFFICIENCY ZONE**
    - Label: "Fast but Risky"
    - Icon: Orange warning
    - Examples: CodeT5, CodeGen (OSS, efficient but less controllable)
    - Scores: CIA 0.8+, Fluency < 0.7
  - **Q3 (Bottom Left, Red): RISK ZONE**
    - Label: "Dependency/Burnout Risk"
    - Icon: Red triangle
    - Examples: Replit AI, TabNine Std, Ghostwriter, Warp
    - Scores: CIA < 0.6, Fluency < 0.6
  - **Q4 (Bottom Right, Blue): LEARNING ZONE**
    - Label: "Onboarding/Transition"
    - Lightly shaded, minimal examples (no mainstream tools)

- **Arrows/Pathways:**

  - Q3→Q1: "Add User Control, Transparency, Resilience"
  - Q2→Q1: "Embed Explainable AI, Lower Friction, Support Teams"
  - Q4→Q1 (optional): "Build Transparency, Expand Controls"

- **Bottom Row:**

  - Toolkit integration icons: assessment forms, pilot templates, UI pattern library, case study callout

- **Example Case Box:**

  - JetBrains AI Assistant in regulated team — CIA 0.92, Fluency 1.27. Actions: Audit Trail, Embedded Onboarding, Team Review. associated with Q1 (same color border)

- **Legend/Glossary (Corner):**

  - CIA 2.0 = Control & Transparency
  - Fluency 2.0 = Usability, Sustainability

- **Design Style:**

  - Modern, minimal, business/professional
  - Large quadrant labels, subtle gradients, color-coded icons
  - Clear, thick arrows for action pathways
  - Caption: "Quadrant shows how diagnostic metrics guide real-world improvement. Green = target. Red = risk. Strategic arrows: where to intervene for sustainable, human-centered AI partnership."

## 2. Conceptual Framework Flowchart

**Prompt:**
Design a clean, vertical flowchart visually mapping the cognitive sovereignty framework.

- **Start Node:** "AI-mediated Workflow"

- **Branches:**

  - "Transparency Layer" (with icons for explainability, confidence, and AI origin labels)
  - "User Control Layer" (override, edit, reject, full audit trail)
  - "Metacognitive Prompts" (reflection reminders, authorship highlights)

- **End Nodes:**

  - "Preserved Cognitive Agency"
  - "Human–AI Collaboration"

- **Icons:**

  - Eye (Transparency)
  - Shield/Check (Control)
  - Lightbulb (Metacognition)

- **Microtext:** Concise explanations under each step (e.g., "User can see and adjust all AI interventions.")

- **Visual Style:**

  - Minimal, professional
  - Color accent for each function
  - Clean separation of each process
  - Suitable for academic or policy presentation

## 3. CIA Metrics Dashboard UI

**Prompt:**
Generate a modern, analytics-focused dashboard interface for cognitive sovereignty metrics.

- **Header:** "Cognitive Impact Assessment — Live Metrics Overview"

- **Widgets:**

  - **Transparency Index (TI):** Large gauge/donut chart, % disclosed actions
  - **Agency Preservation Score (APS):** Gauge/trend line, override/accept ratio
  - **Metacognitive Awareness Rate (MAR):** Trend line, % reflective interactions
  - **Authorship Clarity Ratio (ACR):** Pie chart, human vs AI authorship breakdown

- **Sidebar/Panel:**

  - "Live Alerts" (e.g., "Transparency Index below 75%! Review required.")
  - "Recent Activity" feed: last 3 user/AI interactions with micro-metrics

- **Visual Style:**

  - Modern SaaS UI, blue and green accent colors, white background
  - Responsive design elements, clear icons
  - Shadowed cards, visually separated metric panels

---

## 4. User Interface Mockup: AI-Assisted Writing Editor

**Prompt:**
Produce a detailed digital mockup of an AI-augmented writing editor emphasizing cognitive sovereignty.

- **Main Document Pane:**

  - AI-suggested text: visually highlighted, labeled "Suggested by AI"
  - Inline edit/reject/accept buttons next to suggestions

- **Control Bar/Toggles:**

  - "Show AI Confidence"
  - "Enable/Disable Suggestions"
  - "Audit Trail"

- **Sidebar:**

  - Author attribution pie chart (real-time % human vs AI text)
  - Editable authorship tags

- **Footer/Prompts:**

  - Micro-prompts (e.g., "Why did you accept this suggestion?")
  - Tips: "Your authorship: 67% human, 33% AI."

- **Design Style:**

  - Clean, modern SaaS (think Google Docs or Notion with advanced overlays)
  - High contrast between human and AI content
  - Extra sovereignty controls always visible

---

**Instructions:**

- Each prompt is designed for use in Figma, Illustrator, or AI image generation tools.
- Maintain accessibility and clarity for academic, UX, or policy audiences.
- Prioritize visually distinct representation of cognitive sovereignty features.
